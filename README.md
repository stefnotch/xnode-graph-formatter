# xnode-graph-formatter
An [xNode](https://github.com/Siccity/xNode) graph formatter


[This file contains all the relevant formatting code](https://github.com/stefnotch/xnode-graph-formatter/blob/master/Assets/Examples/MathGraph/Editor/MathGraphEditor.cs). I'm placing it into public domain.

For those who are curious, [the formatting code made its way into the FlaxEngine](https://github.com/FlaxEngine/FlaxEngine/issues/50). If you're interested, hit me up.
